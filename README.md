# calorie-tracker
App for tracking calories heavily inspired by [Macrofactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/). For looking up calories the plan is to use either [OFF](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) or [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide). Authentication will be done using OAuth and Google as the provider. Room will be used as a local db on the device.
